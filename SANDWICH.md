Building the perfect sandwich is an art. Whether you're packing lunch or becoming a sandwich chef, here's a step by step guide to making a sandwich that blows people away.

## 1. Gather Your Ingredients

Just like writing a good code, it all starts with the right tools.

- **Bread**: The base of your sandwich structure (white, sourdough, or for the weak, wholemeal).
- **Spread**: Adds flavor, moisture, and depth. Favourite choices such as mayo, mustard, olive oil, or even tomato sardine sauce.
- **Protein**: This is your sandwich logic (turkey, ham, tofu, eggs).
- **Cheese**: Not mandatory but highly recommended to level up.
- **Crunch**: Lettuce, cucumber, pickles, onion, or anything that provides the ASMR.
- **Extras**: Tomato, avocado, bacon, even chips if you're adventureous.

> *Tip*: Choose ingredients that complement each other (not everything needs to be in a sandwich).

## 2. Toast if You Must

Toasting can add structure and warmth. If your bread is too floppy, give it a quick toast. This is like adding CSS to plain HTML. A bit of style makes everything better.

## 3. Layer with Logic

Think like you're stacking divs:

1. Start with **bottom bread**.
2. Add **spread** to prevent sogginess.
3. Layer **protein**, **cheese**, and then **veggies**.
4. Top with **extras** and finally, your **top bread**.

> *Tip*: Put wet ingredients (like tomatoes or pickles) in the middle so they donâ€™t make the bread soggy.

## 4. Cut, and Serve

* Cut diagonally (because science says it tastes better that way).
* Serve with a side (chips, salad, or just good vibes).

### Summary

Like writing a clean code, a perfect sandwich is all about balance, structure, and a little bit of personality. Make your sandwich with style & confidence!
